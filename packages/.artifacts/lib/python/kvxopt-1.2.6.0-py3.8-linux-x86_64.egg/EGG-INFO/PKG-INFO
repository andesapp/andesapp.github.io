Description: 
        KVXOPT is a fork from CVXOPT wich contains more functions and
        wrappers to Suite Sparse library.
        
        CVXOPT is a free software package for convex optimization based on the
        Python programming language. It can be used with the interactive Python
        interpreter, on the command line by executing Python scripts, or
        integrated in other software via Python extension modules. Its main
        purpose is to make the development of software for convex optimization
        applications straightforward by building on Python's extensive standard
        library and on the strengths of Python as a high-level programming
        language.
